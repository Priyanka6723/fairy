				Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her. Everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>
One day her mother said to her: “Go my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.”<br><br>
Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately.<br>
As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf. He asked her where she was going.<br><br>

“I am going to see my grandmother.”<br>
“Does she live far off?” said the wolf.<br>
“It is beyond that mill you see there”.<br>
It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman’s house. He knocked at the door.
Tap, tap, tap.  “Who’s there?”<br>
“Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,” replied the wolf,  faking her voice.
The good grandmother called out,“Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”<br>
The wolf pulled the string and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment.

Tap, tap, tap.<br>  “Who’s there?”  “It is your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood.”<br>
The wolf cried out, “Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”
Little Red Riding Hood pulled the string, and the door opened.<br><br><br>

Fortunately, a hunter was passing near by the hut. He heard the wolf, and recognised him right away. He ran over to the window. He took a good aim, and that was the end of the wolf.
